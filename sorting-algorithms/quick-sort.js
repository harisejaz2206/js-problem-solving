/*

Quick Sort:

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²) (Occurs when pivot selection is poor)

Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion)

Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array around it, recursively sorting the subarrays.
